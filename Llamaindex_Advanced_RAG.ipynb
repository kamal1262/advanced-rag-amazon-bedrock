              " 'text': 'This one fact alone\\ndemonstrates that the Hsia rejected Chinese culture and were\\nnationalistic Hun. Thus there were now two realms in North China, one\\nundergoing progressive sinification, the other falling back to the old\\ntraditions of the Huns.\\n\\n3 _Rise of the Toba to a great Power_\\n\\nThe present province of Szechwan, in the west, had belonged to Fu\\nChien\\'s empire. At the break-up of the Tibetan state that province\\npassed to the southern Chinese empire and gave the southern Chinese\\naccess, though it was very difficult access, to the caravan route\\nleading to Turkestan. The small states in Kansu, which dominated the\\nroute, now passed on the traffic along two routes, one northward to the\\nToba and the other alien states in north China, the other through\\nnorth-west Szechwan to south China. In this way the Kansu states were\\nstrengthened both economically and politically, for they were able to\\ndirect the commerce either to the northern states or to south China as\\nsuited them. When the South Chinese saw the break-up of Fu Chien\\'s\\nempire into numberless fragments, Liu Yü, who was then all-powerful at\\nthe South Chinese court, made an attempt to conquer the whole of western\\nChina. A great army was sent from South China into the province of\\nShensi, where the Tibetan empire of the \"Later Ch\\'in\" was situated. The\\nCh\\'in appealed to the Toba for help, but the Toba were themselves too\\nhotly engaged to be able to spare troops. They also considered that\\nSouth China would be unable to maintain these conquests, and that they\\nthemselves would find them later an easy prey. Thus in 417 the state of\\n\"Later Ch\\'in\" received a mortal blow from the South Chinese army. Large\\nnumbers of the upper class fled to the Toba. As had been foreseen, the\\nSouth Chinese were unable to maintain their hold over the conquered\\nterritory, and it was annexed with ease by the Hun Ho-lien P\\'o-p\\'o. But\\nwhy not by the Toba?\\n\\nTowards the end of the fourth century, vestiges of Hun, Hsien-pi, and\\nother tribes had united in Mongolia to form the new people of the\\nJuan-juan (also called Ju-juan or Jou-jan). Scholars disagree as to\\nwhether the Juan-juan were Turks or Mongols; European investigators\\nbelieve them to have been identical with the Avars who appeared in the\\nNear East in 558 and later in Europe, and are inclined, on the strength\\nof a few vestiges of their language, to regard them as Mongols.\\nInvestigations concerning the various tribes, however, show that among\\nthe Juan-juan there were both Mongol and Turkish tribes, and that the\\nquestion cannot be decided in favour of either group. Some of the tribes\\nbelonging to the Juan-juan had formerly lived in China. Others had lived\\nfarther north or west and came into the history of the Far East now for\\nthe first time.\\n\\nThis Juan-juan people threatened the Toba in the rear, from the north.\\nIt made raids into the Toba empire for the same reasons for which the\\nHuns in the past had raided agrarian China; for agriculture had made\\nconsiderable progress in the Toba empire. Consequently, before the Toba\\ncould attempt to expand southward, the Juan-juan peril must be removed.\\nThis was done in the end, after a long series of hard and not always\\nsuccessful struggles. That was why the Toba had played no part in the\\nfighting against South China, and had been unable to take immediate\\nadvantage of that fighting.\\n\\nAfter 429 the Juan-juan peril no longer existed, and in the years that\\nfollowed the whole of the small states of the west were destroyed, one\\nafter another, by the Toba--the \"Hsia kingdom\" in 431, bringing down\\nwith it the \"Western Ch\\'in\", and the \"Northern Liang\" in 439. The\\nnon-Chinese elements of the population of those countries were moved\\nnorthward and served the Toba as soldiers; the Chinese also, especially\\nthe remains of the Kansu \"Western Liang\" state (conquered in 420), were\\nenslaved, and some of them transferred to the north. Here again,\\nhowever, the influence of the Chinese gentry made itself felt after a\\nshort time. As we know, the Chinese of \"Western Liang\" in Kansu had\\noriginally migrated there from eastern China.',\n",
